CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

The government-wide reappointment proportion shows a STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT
INCREASING trend over the 12-year period (2013-2024).

The annual increase is 1.32278 percentage points per year (p = 0.008670).
This means that, on average, the reappointment rate has been changing by
approximately 1.32 percentage points each year.

Over the entire 12-year period, the reappointment proportion has changed by
14.55 percentage points.

The model explains 51.4% of the variance in the data (RÂ² = 0.5142).
