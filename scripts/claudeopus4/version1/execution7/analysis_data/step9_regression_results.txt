REGRESSION DIAGNOSTICS:
Durbin-Watson statistic: 1.4003
  → Indicates positive autocorrelation in residuals
Outliers detected (|standardized residual| > 2): 0

INTERPRETATION:
Trend direction: INCREASING
Statistical significance: YES (α = 0.05)
Annual change: 1.3272 percentage points per year
Total change over 12 years: 15.93 percentage points

CONCLUSIONS:
1. The government-wide reappointment proportion shows a STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT
   INCREASING trend over the 12-year period (p = 0.007107).
2. The model explains 53.2% of the variance in reappointment proportions.
3. For each year, the reappointment proportion changes by 1.3272
   percentage points on average.
