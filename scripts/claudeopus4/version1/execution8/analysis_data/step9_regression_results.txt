REGRESSION DIAGNOSTICS:
  Durbin-Watson statistic: 1.5081
    (No significant autocorrelation detected)

  Outlier detection (|standardized residual| > 2):
    No outliers detected

TREND ANALYSIS:
  Annual change: 1.3775 percentage points per year
  Total change over 11 years: 15.15 percentage points
  Projected proportion in 2025: 36.76%

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TEST:
  Null hypothesis (H₀): No trend (slope = 0)
  Alternative hypothesis (H₁): Trend exists (slope ≠ 0)
  Significance level (α): 0.05
  Test statistic: t = 3.2172
  P-value: 0.009219

CONCLUSIONS:
============================================================
1. TREND DIRECTION: INCREASING
2. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT: YES
3. At the 5% significance level, we REJECT the null hypothesis.
   There is sufficient evidence of a increasing trend.
4. The reappointment proportion is changing by 1.3775 percentage
   points per year (95% CI: [0.4235, 2.3316]).

FINAL ANSWER:
------------------------------------------------------------
The government-wide reappointment proportion is INCREASING
over the 12-year period at a rate of 1.3775 percentage points
per year, and this trend IS statistically significant (p = 0.009219).
