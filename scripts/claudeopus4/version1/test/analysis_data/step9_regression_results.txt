CONCLUSIONS:
======================================================================
1. The government-wide reappointment proportion shows a statistically significant
   INCREASING trend over the 12-year period (p = 0.009219 < 0.05).

2. The proportion is increasing by approximately 1.378
   percentage points per year.

3. The model explains 50.9% of the variance in reappointment proportions.

4. With 95% confidence, the true annual change is between 0.423
   and 2.332 percentage points per year.
