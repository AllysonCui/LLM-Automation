STEP 9: LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS - COMPREHENSIVE RESULTS
======================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Which government branch in New Brunswick most frequently reappoints
past appointees, and is this trend increasing or declining?

REGRESSION MODEL:
y = -3074.452 + 1.529 * year
where y = annual reappointment proportion (%)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Trend Direction: INCREASING
2. Rate of Change: 1.529% per year
3. Statistical Significance: *** (p < 0.001)
4. Model Fit (R²): 0.895 (89.5% of variance explained)

STATISTICAL DETAILS:
- Slope: 1.5288 (95% CI: [1.1608, 1.8968])
- Intercept: -3074.452
- Standard Error: 0.1652
- P-value: 0.000003
- Correlation (r): 0.9463
- RMSE: 1.8028

MODEL DIAGNOSTICS:
- Residual Normality: Pass (p = 0.8019)
- Autocorrelation (DW): 1.9531 (No autocorrelation)

PREDICTIONS:
- 2025: 21.32%
- 2026: 22.85%
- 2027: 24.38%


BRANCH-SPECIFIC TRENDS:
- Other: +2.550% per year * (R² = 0.684)
- Health: +2.412% per year  (R² = 0.253)
- Administrative: +1.279% per year  (R² = 0.197)
- Education: +1.011% per year  (R² = 0.323)
- Executive: +0.993% per year  (R² = 0.122)
- Judicial: -0.461% per year  (R² = 0.045)


INTERPRETATION:
The regression analysis reveals a statistically significant increasing trend in government-wide reappointment proportions over the 12-year period (2013-2024).

The reappointment proportion changes by 1.529% per year, meaning that each year, the percentage of appointments that are reappointments increases by approximately 1.53 percentage points.

With an R² of 0.895, the linear model explains 89.5% of the variance in reappointment proportions, suggesting a strong linear relationship.
