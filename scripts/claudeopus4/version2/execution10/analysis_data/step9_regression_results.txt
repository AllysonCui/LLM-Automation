STEP 9: LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS
============================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Is the trend in government-wide reappointment rates increasing or declining?

DATA SUMMARY:
  Period analyzed: 2013 - 2024
  Number of years: 12
  Starting rate: 0.79%
  Ending rate: 13.16%
  Mean rate: 9.24%
  Standard deviation: 4.29%

REGRESSION MODEL:
  Reappointment_Percentage = 2.7613 + 1.1778 * Year_Index

MODEL COEFFICIENTS:
  Intercept: 2.7613
  Slope: 1.1778
  Slope 95% CI: [0.8997, 1.4559]
  Standard Error: 0.1248

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
  R-squared: 0.8990
  Correlation coefficient (r): 0.9482
  p-value: 2.6985e-06

HYPOTHESIS TEST:
  Null hypothesis (H0): No trend in reappointment rates (slope = 0)
  Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a trend in reappointment rates (slope ≠ 0)
  Significance level: α = 0.05
  Decision: Reject H0

INTERPRETATION:
  1. Trend Direction: INCREASING
     - The reappointment rate is increasing by 1.1778 percentage points per year
  2. Statistical Significance: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT
     - The trend is statistically significant at the 0.05 level (p = 2.6985e-06)
  3. Effect Size: STRONG
     - Correlation coefficient r = 0.9482
  4. Practical Significance:
     - Total change over period: 12.96 percentage points
     - Average annual change: 1.1778 percentage points

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS:
  1. Durbin-Watson statistic: 1.5130
     - Interpretation: No significant autocorrelation
  2. Shapiro-Wilk test for normality:
     - Statistic: 0.9577
     - p-value: 0.7509
     - Interpretation: Residuals appear normally distributed

CONCLUSION:
The analysis provides strong statistical evidence that the government-wide reappointment rate is INCREASING over time.
