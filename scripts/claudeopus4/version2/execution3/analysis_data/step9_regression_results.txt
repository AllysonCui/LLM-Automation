RESEARCH QUESTION:
Is the government-wide reappointment trend increasing or declining over the past 12 years?

ANSWER:
The reappointment trend is INCREASING and highly significant (p < 0.001).

DATA SUMMARY:
- Years analyzed: 2013 to 2024 (12 data points)
- Reappointment rate range: 1.35% to 20.00%
- Mean reappointment rate: 11.55%
- Standard deviation: 5.65%

REGRESSION EQUATION:
Reappointment Rate = -3111.9056 + 1.5474 × Year

KEY FINDINGS:
- Slope: 1.5474% per year
  → The reappointment rate increasing by approximately 1.5474 percentage points each year
- R-squared: 0.8943
  → The linear model explains 89.4% of the variation in reappointment rates
- P-value: 0.0000
  → The trend is highly significant (p < 0.001)

STATISTICAL TESTS:
1. Model Significance:
   - F-statistic: 84.6091 (p = 0.0000)
   - The model is statistically significant

2. Residual Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test):
   - Statistic: 0.9498 (p = 0.6342)
   - Residuals are normally distributed

3. Heteroscedasticity (Breusch-Pagan test):
   - Statistic: 1.1205 (p = 0.2898)
   - No evidence of heteroscedasticity

4. Autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson test):
   - Statistic: 2.0137
   - No significant autocorrelation

PREDICTIONS (if current trend continues):
- 2025: 21.60%
- 2026: 23.15%
- 2027: 24.70%

INTERPRETATION:
The analysis reveals a statistically significant increasing trend in government-wide 
reappointment rates. Over the 12-year period, reappointment rates have increased 
by an average of 1.5474 percentage points per year. This suggests that 
the New Brunswick government is increasingly relying on reappointments rather than 
new appointments to fill positions.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the linear regression analysis of 12 years of data, the government-wide 
reappointment rate in New Brunswick is increasing at a rate of 1.5474 
percentage points per year. This trend is highly significant (p < 0.001).
