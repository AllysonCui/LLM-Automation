Generated: 2025-07-19 01:22:53
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
The analysis reveals a statistically significant INCREASING trend in government-wide
reappointment proportions over the study period. The upward trend shows an
average change of 1.323% per year (p = 0.0059).

The linear model explains 54.8% of the variance in reappointment proportions.

RESEARCH QUESTION ANSWER
----------------------------------------
Question: Is the reappointment trend increasing or declining over the past 12 years?

Answer: The trend is STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING.
- The reappointment proportion increases by 1.323% per year on average.
- Over the 12-year period, this represents a total increase of 14.6 percentage points.

Statistical confidence: p-value = 0.0059
Model reliability: RÂ² = 0.548 (54.8% of variance explained)
