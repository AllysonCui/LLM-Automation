LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS
==================================

Research Question: Is the reappointment trend increasing or declining?

DATA SUMMARY:
- Years analyzed: 2013 - 2024
- Number of years: 12
- Mean reappointment proportion: 9.26%
- Standard deviation: 4.25%

REGRESSION RESULTS:
- Slope (annual change): 1.1677% per year
- Intercept: -2347.80%
- R-squared: 0.9015
- Correlation coefficient (r): 0.9495

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
- p-value: 0.000002
- Standard error: 0.1221
- t-statistic: 9.5658
- Degrees of freedom: 10
- 95% Confidence Interval for slope: [0.8957, 1.4397]

INTERPRETATION:

The reappointment trend is SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING.
- The proportion of reappointments increases by approximately 1.168% each year.
- This trend is statistically significant (p = 0.0000 < 0.05).
- Over the 12-year period, reappointments increased by approximately 14.0 percentage points.

MODEL QUALITY:
- R-squared value of 0.901 indicates that 90.1% of the variance in reappointment 
  proportions can be explained by the year.
- This represents a STRONG linear relationship.

PREDICTION:
- Based on the linear trend, the predicted reappointment proportion for 2025 is 16.85%.
- Note: This assumes the linear trend continues, which may not reflect actual future policy changes.
