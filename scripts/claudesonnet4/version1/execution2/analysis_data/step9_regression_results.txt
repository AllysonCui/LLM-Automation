CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------------------
1. TREND DIRECTION: The government-wide reappointment proportion shows a increasing trend over the 11-year period.

2. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The trend is statistically significant (p = 0.0092, α = 0.05).

3. MAGNITUDE: The reappointment proportion changes by approximately 1.3777 percentage points per year, representing an increase.

4. MODEL FIT: The linear model explains 50.9% of the variance in reappointment proportions (R² = 0.5087).

FINAL ANSWER: The government-wide reappointment proportion trend is INCREASING over the 12-year period, and this trend IS statistically significant.
