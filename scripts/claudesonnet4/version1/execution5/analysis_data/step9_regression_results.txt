STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
----------------------------------------
Significance level: α = 0.05
P-value: 0.012096
Is significant: YES
Trend direction: INCREASING

REGRESSION DIAGNOSTICS:
----------------------------------------
Durbin-Watson statistic: 1.5212

  Shapiro-Wilk test: statistic=0.9288, p-value=0.3681
  Jarque-Bera test: statistic=0.9281, p-value=0.6287
  Residuals appear normal: YES

No outliers detected (threshold: |z| > 2.0)

CONCLUSIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. The government-wide reappointment proportion shows a statistically significant increasing trend
   over the 11-year period from 2013 to 2024.

2. The trend is statistically significant (p = 0.0121 < 0.05),
   indicating a real change in reappointment practices over time.

3. The model explains 48.3% of the variation in
   reappointment proportions (R² = 0.4832).

4. The practical significance is MODERATE to HIGH:
   Annual change of +1.34 percentage points represents
   a meaningful shift in government appointment practices.
