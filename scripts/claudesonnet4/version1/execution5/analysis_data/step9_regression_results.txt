REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS
---------------------------
Regression equation: Y = 1.377547 * X + -2752.769149
where Y = reappointment proportion (%) and X = year

Statistical Parameters:
  Slope (β₁): 1.377547 percentage points per year
  Intercept (β₀): -2752.769149
  Correlation coefficient (r): 0.713167
  R-squared (r²): 0.508606
  P-value: 0.00921901
  Standard error of slope: 0.42818380
  95% Confidence interval: [0.423494, 2.331600]

TREND ANALYSIS
--------------
Trend direction: INCREASING
Statistical significance (α = 0.05): SIGNIFICANT
Annual change: +1.377547 percentage points per year
Total change over 11-year period: +15.153 percentage points

INTERPRETATION
--------------
The analysis shows a statistically significant increasing trend
in government-wide reappointment proportions (p = 0.009219 < 0.05).
The reappointment proportion increases by approximately
1.3775 percentage points per year.

MODEL QUALITY ASSESSMENT
------------------------
R-squared value: 0.5086
Model fit quality: Moderate
Percentage of variance explained: 50.9%

REGRESSION DIAGNOSTICS
---------------------
Durbin-Watson statistic: 1.5081
Autocorrelation assessment: No significant autocorrelation
Number of outliers (|z| > 2): 0 out of 12
Residuals normality test (Shapiro-Wilk): p = 0.2271
Residuals distribution: Normal

CONCLUSIONS
-----------
1. The government-wide reappointment proportion shows a increasing trend
   over the 11-year period from 2013 to 2024.

2. This trend is statistically significant
   at the α = 0.05 level (p = 0.009219).

3. The linear model explains 50.9% of the variance in
   reappointment proportions over time.

4. If this trend continues, the reappointment proportion
   would change by approximately 1.3775 percentage points per year.
