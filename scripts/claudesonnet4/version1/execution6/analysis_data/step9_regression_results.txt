CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------------------
The government-wide reappointment proportion shows a statistically significant increasing trend over the 12-year period (p = 0.009 < 0.05).

The proportion increasing by an average of 1.376 percentage points per year, with a total change of +15.134 percentage points from 2013 to 2024.

The linear model explains 50.9% of the variance in reappointment proportions (moderate fit).
