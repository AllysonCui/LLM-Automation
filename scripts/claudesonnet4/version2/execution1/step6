Step 6: Calculate Reappointment Rates
New Brunswick Government Appointments Analysis

This script calculates the reappointment rate as reappointments divided by 
total appointments for each organization-year pair.

Research Question: Which government branch in New Brunswick most frequently 
reappoints past appointees, and is this trend increasing or declining over the past 12 years?
