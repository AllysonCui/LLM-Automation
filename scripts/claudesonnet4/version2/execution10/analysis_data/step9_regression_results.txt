See diagnostic plots for detailed assessment.

INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------------------
Government-wide reappointment rates show a statistically significant upward trend.

The statistical evidence supports a significant linear trend in
government-wide reappointment rates over the 12-year period.

METHODOLOGY:
----------------------------------------
• Data Source: New Brunswick government appointment records (2013-2024)
• Analysis Method: Ordinary Least Squares linear regression
• Dependent Variable: Annual government-wide reappointment proportion
• Independent Variable: Year (centered)
• Sample Size: 12 annual observations
• Significance Level: α = 0.05

LIMITATIONS:
----------------------------------------
• Small sample size (12 years) limits statistical power
• Linear model may not capture complex temporal patterns
• Time series data may exhibit autocorrelation
• External factors not controlled for in analysis
