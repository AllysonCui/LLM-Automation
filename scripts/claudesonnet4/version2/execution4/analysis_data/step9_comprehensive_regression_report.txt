COMPREHENSIVE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Annual Reappointment Proportions (2013-2024)
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
--------------------
• Research Question: Is there a significant trend in government-wide reappointment
  proportions over the 12-year period from 2013 to 2024?

• Key Finding: The analysis reveals a increasing trend that is very significant (p < 0.01).
• Trend Magnitude: Annual reappointment proportions show a increase of 1.6295 percentage points per year
• Model Fit: The linear model explains 52.8% of the variance in annual proportions

DATA SUMMARY:
---------------
• Time Period: 2013 - 2024 (12 years)
• Proportion Range: 15.81% - 40.10%
• Average Proportion: 30.89%
• Total Change: +24.29 percentage points over 11 years

REGRESSION RESULTS:
--------------------
Basic Linear Regression (Y = α + βX + ε):
• Equation: Proportion = 21.9287 + 1.6295 × Time
• Slope (β): 1.629476 percentage points per year
• Intercept (α): 21.9287%
• R-squared: 0.527626
• Correlation: 0.726378
• Standard Error of Slope: 0.487560
• Standard Error of Regression: 5.8304

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
-------------------------
• P-value: 0.00746402
• Significance Level: very significant (p < 0.01)
• 95% Confidence Interval for Slope: [0.543124, 2.715827]
• Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis (β = 0) at α = 0.05
• Interpretation: There IS sufficient evidence of a significant linear trend

ADVANCED STATISTICS (OLS):
-------------------------
• Adjusted R-squared: 0.480388
• F-statistic: 11.1696
• F-statistic p-value: 0.00746402
• Akaike Information Criterion (AIC): 78.18
• Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): 79.15
• Log-likelihood: -37.0903

PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION:
-------------------------
• Annual Rate of Change: 1.6295 percentage points per year (increasing)
• Practical Significance: large
• Projected Total Change (2013-2024): +17.92 percentage points
• Policy Implication: The increasing trend is statistically significant and may
  indicate systematic changes in government reappointment practices

MODEL DIAGNOSTICS SUMMARY:
----------------------------
• Independence (Durbin-Watson): 1.3389 (Positive autocorrelation detected)
• Normality (Shapiro-Wilk): W = 0.9428, p = 0.5352 (satisfied)
• Residual Mean: -0.000000 (should be ≈ 0)
• Residual Std Dev: 5.3224

FINAL CONCLUSIONS:
--------------------
1. Statistical Conclusion:
   There IS a statistically significant increasing trend in annual
   reappointment proportions (p = 0.007464 < 0.05)

2. Effect Size:
   The linear model explains 52.8% of the variance,
   suggesting a moderate linear relationship

3. Research Question Answer:
   YES - New Brunswick government reappointment proportions show
   a statistically significant increasing trend over 2013-2024
