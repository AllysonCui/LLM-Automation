============================================================
✓ Appointment counts file found: scripts/claudesonnet4/version2/execution5/analysis_data/step4_appointment_counts.csv
✓ Reappointment counts file found: scripts/claudesonnet4/version2/execution5/analysis_data/step5_reappointment_counts.csv
✓ Successfully loaded appointment counts dataset
  - Shape: (203, 5)
  - Columns: ['org', 'year', 'total_appointments', 'total_appointments', 'avg_appointments_per_appointment']
✓ Successfully loaded reappointment counts dataset
  - Shape: (516, 5)
  - Columns: ['org', 'year', 'reappointment_count', 'unique_reappointed_appointments', 'avg_reappointments_per_appointment']
✓ All required columns present in both datasets
