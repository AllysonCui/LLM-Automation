Linear Regression Analysis: Reappointment Proportions
============================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Which government branch in New Brunswick most frequently reappoints
past appointees, and is this trend increasing or declining over the past 12 years?

DATA SUMMARY:
Time period: 2013 - 2024
Number of observations: 12
Mean reappointment proportion: 11.55%
Standard deviation: 5.90%

REGRESSION RESULTS:
Slope (β₁): 1.547429 percentage points per year
Intercept (β₀): -3111.938592%
Standard error of slope: 0.168173
t-statistic: 9.2014
p-value: 0.000003
95% Confidence Interval: [1.172716, 1.922141]

MODEL FIT:
R-squared: 0.894365
Adjusted R-squared: 0.883802
F-statistic: 84.6660
F-statistic p-value: 0.000003
Root Mean Square Error: 1.8358%

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS:
Durbin-Watson statistic: 2.0129
Shapiro-Wilk normality test: W = 0.9498, p = 0.633701

INTERPRETation:
- The reappointment proportion shows an INCREASING trend over time
- The trend is STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT at the 5% level
- Total change over 11 years: 17.02 percentage points
- Relative change: 147.4% of baseline proportion
- The linear model explains a substantial portion of the variance

CONCLUSION:
Based on 12 years of data (2013-2024), there is statistically significant evidence that reappointment proportions
are INCREASING over time in New Brunswick government appointments.

The estimated annual change is 1.5474 percentage points per year
(95% CI: [1.1727, 1.9221]).

Notes:
[1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.
[2] The condition number is large, 1.18e+06. This might indicate that there are
strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.
