LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS REPORT
New Brunswick Government Appointments: Reappointment Trend Analysis
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Which government branch in New Brunswick most frequently reappoints past
appointees, and is this trend increasing or declining over the past 12 years?

DATA SUMMARY:
  Study Period: 2013 - 2024
  Sample Size: 12 annual observations
  Dependent Variable: Government-wide annual reappointment proportion (%)
  Independent Variable: Year
  Mean Reappointment Proportion: 9.400%
  Standard Deviation: 4.309%
  Range: 1.081% - 16.000%

REGRESSION RESULTS:
  Model: Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε
  Where Y = Reappointment Proportion (%), X = Year

  Intercept (β₀): -2377.095%
  Slope (β₁): 1.182311 percentage points per year
  Standard Error of Slope: 0.126476
  95% Confidence Interval for Slope: [0.900504, 1.464118]

MODEL FIT STATISTICS:
  R-squared (R²): 0.897316
  Correlation Coefficient (r): 0.947268
  Explained Variance: 89.73%
  Residual Standard Error: 1.3807

HYPOTHESIS TESTING:
  H₀: β₁ = 0 (no trend)
  H₁: β₁ ≠ 0 (significant trend)
  Significance Level: α = 0.05

  t-statistic: 9.3481
  Degrees of Freedom: 10
  P-value (two-tailed): 0.00000294
  Statistical Decision: REJECT H₀

TREND ANALYSIS:
  Trend Direction: INCREASING
  Annual Rate of Change: +1.1823 percentage points per year
  Total Change Over Period: +13.005 percentage points
  Relative Change: +138.3% of baseline mean

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  Result: highly significant (p < 0.001)

MODEL DIAGNOSTICS:
  Model Assumptions Met: 4/4
  Assumption Checks:
    - Linearity: Mean of residuals ≈ 0
    - Normality: Shapiro-Wilk test on residuals
    - Independence: Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation
    - Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals

PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION:
  The analysis provides statistical evidence that government-wide
  reappointment proportions are increasing over time.
  New Brunswick government reappointment practices are becoming more frequent over the study period.

FORECASTING:
  Predicted 2025 Reappointment Proportion: 17.085%
  (Based on linear extrapolation - use with caution)

LIMITATIONS:
  - Linear model assumes constant rate of change
  - Small sample size (12 observations) limits statistical power
  - External factors not considered in model
  - Extrapolation beyond data range increases uncertainty

CONCLUSION:
  Statistically significant increasing trend detected in New Brunswick government reappointment
  proportions over the period 2013-2024.
