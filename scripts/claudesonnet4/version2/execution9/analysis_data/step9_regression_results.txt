STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION
==========================

Trend Analysis:
- Direction: Increasing
- Strength: Strong
- The slope of 1.643 indicates reappointment proportions
  increase by 1.643 percentage points per year on average.

Statistical Significance:
- Level: Highly Significant
- The p-value of 0.0 indicates the probability of observing
  this trend (or stronger) by chance alone is 0.0%.
- Confidence Interval excludes zero, supporting evidence of a real trend.

Effect Size:
- R² = 0.871 (large effect)
- 87.1% of variance in reappointment proportions is explained by time.
- Model fit quality: Excellent

Practical Significance:
- Total predicted change over 12 years: 18.07 percentage points
- From 3.83% to 21.9%
- Practical importance: High

MODEL DIAGNOSTICS
================

Residual Analysis:
- Mean of residuals: -0.0 (bias: minimal)
- Standard deviation: 2.2756
- Durbin-Watson statistic: 2.0523

Model Assumptions:
- Linearity: Assumed based on linear model specification
- Independence: Reasonable
- Homoscedasticity: Check residuals plot in visualization
- Normality: Check Q-Q plot in visualization

  2022: Observed=17.77%, Predicted=18.62%, Residual=-0.85
  2023: Observed=21.53%, Predicted=20.26%, Residual=1.27
  2024: Observed=17.62%, Predicted=21.9%, Residual=-4.28

CONCLUSION
==========

Based on the linear regression analysis of 12 years of data (2013-2024),
there IS statistically significant evidence of a trend in
government-wide reappointment proportions in New Brunswick.

The analysis reveals a strong increasing trend with highly significant statistical support.

Implications:
- Reappointment practices ARE changing systematically over time
- The trend has high practical significance
- Government policy may be shifting toward more reappointments
