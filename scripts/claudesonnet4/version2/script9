Linear Regression Results ({int(years[0])}-{int(years[-1])})

=== RESEARCH QUESTION ===
Which government branch in New Brunswick most frequently reappoints past appointees, 
and is this trend increasing or declining over the past 12 years?

=== REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS ===
Data Points: {n} annual observations
Time Period: {int(years[0])}-{int(years[-1])} ({years_span} years)

Linear Regression Equation:
Reappointment % = {slope:.6f} × Year + {intercept:.6f}

Key Statistics:
- Slope (Coefficient): {slope:.6f}% per year
- Intercept: {intercept:.6f}%
- R-squared: {r_squared:.6f}
- Correlation: {r_value:.6f}
- P-value: {p_value:.6f}
- Standard Error: {std_err:.6f}
- 95% CI for Slope: [{slope_ci_lower:.6f}, {slope_ci_upper:.6f}]

=== TREND DIRECTION ===
COEFFICIENT SIGN: {trend_description.upper()}
TREND DIRECTION: {trend_direction}
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE: {significance}

=== PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION ===
Total Change Over Period: {total_predicted_change:+.3f} percentage points
Relative Change: {percentage_change:+.1f}%
Trend Magnitude: {magnitude}
Model Quality: {r_squared_quality} (R² = {r_squared:.3f})

=== CONCLUSION ===
The linear regression analysis shows that New Brunswick government reappointment 
rates have a {trend_direction.lower()} trend over the {years_span}-year period.
The coefficient is {trend_description} ({slope:.6f}% per year), indicating that
reappointment practices are {trend_direction.lower()} over time.

This trend is {significance.lower()} at the 95% confidence level (p = {p_value:.6f}).
