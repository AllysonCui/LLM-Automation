Code Generating Guidance

**Dataset and Environment Context:**
- You have 12 CSV files containing New Brunswick government appointment data from 2013-2024
- File naming convention: appointments_2013.csv, appointments_2014.csv, ..., appointments_2024.csv
- Files are located in: raw_data
- Save all intermediate results to: steps/gpt4o/version2/analysis_data/
- Use this exact file naming convention for outputs:
  - step1_combined_appointments.csv
  - step2_key_columns_data.csv
  - step3_repeats_marked.csv
  - step4_employee_counts.csv
  - step5_reappointment_counts.csv
  - step6_reappointment_rates.csv
  - step7_yearly_max_rates.csv
  - step7_yearly_max_reappointment_rates.png
  - step8_annual_proportions.csv
  - step8_annual_reappointment_proportions.png
  - step9_regression_results.txt

**Required Python Libraries:**
- pandas for data manipulation
- numpy for calculations
- scipy.stats for regression analysis
- pathlib for file handling
- Standard error handling and validation practices

**Data Structure Expectations:**
- Each CSV contains columns that may include: name, position, organization/org, reappointed, dates, etc.
- Column names may vary slightly between years (handle inconsistencies)
- The "reappointed" column may be boolean (True/False) or text values
- Handle missing values and data quality issues appropriately

**Code Requirements:**
- Include comprehensive error handling and file existence checking
- Print progress updates and validation statistics at each step
- Document all analytical decisions and assumptions in comments
- Create output directories if they don't exist
- Validate data integrity between steps

**Research Question:**
Which government branch in New Brunswick most frequently reappoints past appointees, and is this trend increasing or declining, over the past 12 years?



Prompt 1:
Use code generating guidance, do step 1:
combine 12 raw datasets



Prompt 2:
Use code generating guidance, do step 2:
find and keep the key columns ("reappointed", "name", "position", "org")



Prompt 3:
Use code generating guidance, do step 3:
if a "name" repeats under the same "position" and "org", mark "reappointed" as true except for the first appearance



Prompt 4:
Use code generating guidance, do step 4:
count number of employees for each "org" for each year



Prompt 5:
Use code generating guidance, do step 5:
count the times each "org" appears when "reappointed" is true for each year



Prompt 6:
Use code generating guidance, do step 6:
divide the count with the total employees for each year



Prompt 7:
Use code generating guidance, do step 7:
find the "org" with the max proportion for each year, where proportion is the rate of "reappointed"/total



Prompt 8:
Use code generating guidance, do step 8:
calculate the proportion across all appointments by each year



Prompt 9:
Use code generating guidance, do step 9:
fit a linear regression on the annual data points and see if the coefficient is positive or negative
